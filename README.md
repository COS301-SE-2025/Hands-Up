## Project Description 

Hands UP is an innovative application that bridges the communication gap between signers and non-signers. Using advanced AI technology, the application detects andtranslates sign language in real-time through the device's camera, converting signs into both text and spoken language without significant delays. Beyond translation, it also serves as an interactive learning platform with structured lessons andimmediate feedback on signing accuracy.

Thus, the system focuses on three core functionalities: 
1. Real-time sign language translation
2. Interactive learning with AI-powered feedback 
3. Progress tracking for users
